First, the regular Cellular Automata with probability algorithm to determine the behavior of the stormy weather using the dataset

Second, the hybrid model of Cellular Automata with Random Forest Algorithm to determine the probability of the variables from the dataset

Third, normalization of the outputs (CA output, Hybrid output, normalized true stormy weather course) then compare the three to determine which model is more accurate
